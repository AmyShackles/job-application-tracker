# JobTracker2020

Frustrated at the manual necessity of having to move jobs I'd applied to from the Applied Today column to the Applied column in order to hold myself accountable to daily targets, I decided to implement my own job application tracking system with all of the features I wish the one I had been using had.

### Structure

**Boards** - A collection of boards so that you can have multiple job searches at a time - say you want to split up the type of job you're applying to (front-end, back-end, full-stack) - or if you want to keep a record of previous job searches and use the product later when on the hunt again.

**Board** - A collection of Lists

**List** - A collection of Cards

**Card** - Data about a specific application. Date applied, description of job, job post URL, notes, scheduled follow-ups or interviews, etc.

Filter options - Date applied, company, position, location, salary
